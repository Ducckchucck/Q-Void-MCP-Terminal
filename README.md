## 🚀 Overview

**QVoid MCP Terminal** is an advanced, post-quantum-ready AI cybersecurity engine that fuses real-time network packet inspection, modular machine learning defense systems, and dynamic encrypted command pipelines — all inside a blazing fast terminal.

Developed as part of the **QVoid Cyber Framework**, this tool acts as the **MCP** (Model Control Protocol) nucleus, intelligently routing data between multiple AI models, plugins, encryption layers, and forensic logs.

## 🔒 Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **🛡️ Real-time Defense** | Intercepts and classifies live packets via ASTL (AI-Simulated Threat Layers) |
| **🧠 MCP Logic** | Dynamically routes packets to appropriate ML models using in-memory hybrid control |
| **🔌 Plugin Ecosystem** | Drop-in support for new attack models (phishing, malware, SQLi, SYN flood, etc.) |
| **🔐 QVoidCrypt v2.0** | Hybrid AES+RSA encryption layer with HMAC, logging, and benchmarking |
| **📡 Simulation Mode** | Attack simulator with controlled fake feed (Scapy) for model stress testing |
| **🧬 DNA Feature Core** | Intelligent feature extraction + vectorization system shared across models |
| **🗂️ Audit Logging** | .qvoidlog and .jsonl logging for forensic analysis and traceability |
| **💻 AI Assistant Hook (SIA)** | Terminal is pre-integrated with SIA for contextual command routing |

## 🧬 Model Integration

QVoid uses a hybrid model system divided by attack type and contributor. Each is trained on isolated data pipelines and merged via MCP logic:

- **Infiltration Detection** – Jeya Model  
- **SQL Injection Detection & CICIDS ** – Piyush Model  
- **SYN Flood Mitigation** – Akhilesh Model  
- **Phishing Classification** – Shrikant Model  
- **Malware Detection (Roadmap)** – DNA Layer in progress  
- **Anomaly & Zero-Day** – Unsupervised route handled by MCP fallback logic
